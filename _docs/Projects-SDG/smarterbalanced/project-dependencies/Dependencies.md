## Internal Dependencies

### NPM
NPM is required to install Grunt, Grunt packages, Less, and TypeScript. 
See `package.json` in the **Web** project for configurations.

### Bower
Bower is required to add Bootstrap, JQuery, and React.
See `bower.json` in the **Web** project for configurations.

### Grunt
Grunt is used to perform tasks with Visual Studio events as well as with build events.
Grunt:
- Compiles TypeScript files into JavaScript on save and build
- Compiles Less CSS into CSS on save and build
- Minifies CSS on build
- Removes temp files

For Grunt configurations, see `Gruntfile.js` in the **Web** project.


## External Dependencies

### Docker
Docker is used to simplify and unify the build and runtime environment for the 
application. 

See `Dockerfile` in the **Web** project for Docker configurations.
The **Web** project also contains a `.dockerignore`. 

### TravisCI
TravisCI is used to verify the state of the application every time a developer
pushes to a branch in the GitHub repository. It first installs project dependencies, 
pulls and builds the project, and then runs tests. 

After the previous steps succeed, Travis builds a Docker image with the application
and pushes it to AWS.

On the **dev**, **stage**, and **master** branches, Travis triggers a build process in AWS that
combines the content package, hosted in an S3 bucket, with the application Docker 
image and performs a rolling update to the running versions of these branches.

See the `travis.yml` file in the root directory project for configurations.

### Content package
The content for the site is provided by a content package supplied by the Smarter Balanced 
Assessment Consortium. It consists of XML files that describe the test question items 
(the "content package"). 

Currently, content packages can be accessed at 
[ftp://ftps.smarterbalanced.org/~sbacpublic/Public/PracticeAndTrainingTests/](ftp://ftps.smarterbalanced.org/~sbacpublic/Public/PracticeAndTrainingTests/).
