### Project Architecture
The Sample Items Website project is composed of three layers: Web, Core, and Dal.

**Web** is the startup project and contains controllers, views, style, and other
web dependencies. See the **Dependencies** section for more information.

**Core** provides business logic to Web via repositories. It also houses the business
logic for the diagnosticAPI and model translations.

**Dal** provides data to the Core layer. All data is supplied by a "content package" 
which is a set of XML files that represent test question items. This XML is 
parsed into the immutable `ItemDigest` and `ItemCard` models, which are used
throughout the application. 

Other XML data is used, such as `AccessibilityAccommodationConfigurations`, 
`ClaimConfigurations`, and `InteractionTypeConfigurations`. These configure
information such as order and labels for accessibility and interaction types.

**Test** is the test project for Sample Items Website. It contains unit tests
and integration tests for each of the three aforementioned layers.
